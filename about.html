								The Syro-Malabar Church is an Apostolic Church which traces its origin to the Apostolate
								of St. Thomas who, according to the tradition, landed at Cranganore in 52 AD and founded
								seven Christian communities at Palayur, Cranganore, Kokkamangalam, Kottakavu (Parur),
								Quilon, Niranam, and Chayal. It is one of the 22 sui iuris Oriental Churches in Catholic
								Communion with its own particular characteristics expressed in worship, spirituality,
								theology and disciplinary laws. The early Christian community in India was known as St.
								Thomas Christians. In the course of history this Church entered into life-relation with
								the Christian communities which came to be known as the East Syrian Church. This
								relationship made the Thomas Christians share the liturgical, spiritual and other
								ecclesiastical traditions with the East Syrian Church. At the same time St. Thomas
								Christians kept their distinctive character especially in Church administration and
								socio-cultural and ascetico-spiritual life. In the 16th Century with the arrival of the
								Portuguese, a new era began in the life of this Church, i.e., the latinization of its
								liturgy and the efforts of the St. Thomas Christians to free itself from this situation.
								In the Nineteenth Century this Church was designated as the Syro-Malabar Church in the
								documents from the Roman Curia under which name it is known today.
								<br><br>
								In 1887 the St. Thomas Christians were re-organized under two Vicariates, Kottayam and
								Trichur. In 1896, when the St. Thomas Christians obtained bishops of their own rite and
								nation, they were further reorganized into three Vicariates, Trichur, Ernakulam and
								Changanacherry. On December 21, 1923, the Syro-Malabar Hierarchy was established with
								Ernakulam as the Metropolitan See and Trichur and Changanacherry and Kottayam
								(established in 1911 for the Southists) as suffragans. In 1956 Changanacherry was raised
								to the status of a Metropolitan See. On December 16, 1992, Pope John Paul II raised the
								Syro-Malabar Church to the status of Major Archiepiscopal sui iuris Church with the
								title of Ernakulam-Angamaly. Mar Antony Paidyara, the then Metropolitan of Ernakulam was
								appointed its Major Archbishop with Mar Abraham Kattumana as the Pontifical Delegate who
								discharged the duties of the Major Archbishop. Archbishop Kattumana died unexpectedly
								during his visit to Rome in April 1995 and Mar Padiyara was given the powers of the
								Major Archbishop. In November 1996 Cardinal Padiyara resigned from his office as Major
								Archbishop. In his place Archbishop Varkey Vithayathil, C.Ss.R. was appointed as the
								Apostolic Administrator. In December 1998 he was appointed Major Archbishop by the Pope.
								In February 2001 Archbishop Vithayathil was created a Cardinal by Pope John Paul II.
								<br><br>
								At present there are five Archdioceses - Ernakulam-Angamaly, Changanacherry, Trichur,
								Tellicherry and Kottayam and 13 eparchies - Idukki, Kothamangalam, Kanjirappally, Palai,
								Thuckalay, Belthangady, Bhadravathi, Mananthavady, Mandya, Thamarassery, Irinjalakuda,
								Palghat, and Ramanathapuram within the proper territory of the Major Archiepiscopal
								Church and 11 eparchies outside - Bijnor, Gorakhpur, Sagar, Satna, Ujjain, Klyan,
								Rajkot, Adilabad, Chanda, Jagdalpur and Shamshabad; 6 eparchies outside jurisdictions -
								Faridabad, Hosur, Mississaugua, Melbourne, Chicago, and England. There are 41,89,349
								faithful, with 7,252 priests (3,617 diocesan and 3,635 religious), and 34,769 women
								religious and 4729 men religious.

								The history of the Diocese of Kalyan is very much intertwined with the history of the
								Syro - Malabar Church itself in India. Having its roots in the Apostolic Ministry of St.
								Thomas the Apostle himself who established seven communities of the Christian Church in
								Kerala in the first century itself. These Christians migrated to different parts of
								India. They concentrated mainly in the big cities of India. In Bombay, Pune and Nasik
								regions, they are found in large numbers. The spiritual care of these regions are
								assisted by lay association like Kerala Catholic Association (Bombay). St. Thomas
								Christians of India (Pune), etc.
								<br><br>
								On September 8, 1978 Pope John Paul II appointed His Eminence Antony Cardinal Padiyara,
								the then Archbishop of Changanacherry as the Apostolic Visitor to study the situation.
								The visit of Pope John Paul II to India in 1986 gave him a first hand experience of the
								living faith of the Syro - Malabar Christians of India. A Pontifical Commission was
								appointed and on the basis of its report came the all-important letter of the Pope to
								the Bishops of India observing that the present situation in Bombay - Pune region is
								mature for the Churches to take necessary steps in this regard. Finally on May 19th
								1988, His Holiness Pope John Paul II made the announcement of the establishment of a new
								diocese for the Syro - Malabar Christians of Bombay - Pune - Nasik regions, the Diocese
								of Kalyan, and the designation of Mgr. Paul Chittilapilly as its first Bishop. The Bill,
								however, was signed by the Pope on April 30, 1988. Thus the birth of the diocese and the
								appointment of the first Bishop took effect from April 30,1988. The Episcopal Ordination
								and the official inauguration of the diocese took place on August 24, 1988 at the Don
								Bosco Grounds, Matunga, Mumbai.
								<br><br>
								After nine years of dedicated and pioneering work in the newly born diocese, Bishop Paul
								Chittilappilly was transferred to the diocese of Thamarassery in Kerala on December 18,
								1996 and took charge on February 13, 1997. His successor and the second bishop of Kalyan
								Diocese was Mar Thomas Elavanal, whose consecration was on February 8, 1997 at Kannamwar
								Nagar, Vikhroli, Mumbai.
